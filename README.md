## How to Download and Use

1. **Download the Repository**  
   Click the green **code** button, then select **Download ZIP**.

2. **Extract the Files**  
   Unzip the downloaded file.

3. **(Optional) Move the Folder**  
   You may move the extracted folder to a preferred location, such as `C:\Program Files\`.

4. **Run the Application**  
   Inside the extracted folder, run `VRtualJoy.bat`.  
   A console window will open, showing the status of the virtual controller.

5. **Test the Virtual Controller**  
   Launch `joy.cpl` to test the virtual controller, which is set to **XINPUT** by default.

6. **Configure Controller Type**  
   Use `main_config.json` to change the controller type (`DS4` or `XINPUT`).

7. **Customize Settings**  
   You can adjust settings and remap keys for each virtual controller type by editing `main_config.json`.

**Note: VRtualJoy was tested and works with Windows 11.
